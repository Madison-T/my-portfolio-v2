          <p>
            I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with a double major in Software Development and Data Science. I started out in chemistry, then spent two years teaching English in Japan before discovering a passion for tech.

          <p>
            A YouTube series on computer science sparked my curiosity, and I enrolled in uni again while still working full-time. Iâ€™ve since built full-stack apps, contributed to research, and explored everything from data analysis to real-time interactive web and mobile apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm endlessly curious and love understanding how things work. Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, scrapbooking, playing board games and TCGs.
